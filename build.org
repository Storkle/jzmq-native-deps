commit date: December 29, 2010
* 2.0.10.1
added support for windows x86
* 2.0.10.2 , Feb. 12
fixed bug in jzmq library - need to use zmq_errno() instead of errno for windows, otherwise errors are always thrown as "No Error". So i went into the source
code and replaced errno by zmq_errno() for everything - hopefully i didnt make any mistakes!
* 2.0.10.3, Feb 13
changed jzmq on windows to release build. added windows x86_64 directory with 32 bit dll in it (see README).
* 2.0.10.4 March 7
added 64 bit linux so file
